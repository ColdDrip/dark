#React
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Although few studies have examined the effects of news on consumersâ€™ affective state (Szabo & Hopkinson, 2007), it is commonly understood that news can and does psychologically impact those who consume it (Sisson, 2016; Singal, 2016; Gregoire, 2015; Davey, 2012) but not always in the ways we might expect (Brutality-Desensitization Process Nearly Complete, 1999). 

While affective data has already been utilized for recommender systems (Tkalcic, Kosir & Tasic, 2011), the application of affective feedback to news consumption is an unexplored space. There are no commercial products or applications designed to bring ordinary news consumers awareness of their affective state while consuming news. 

Our concept, React, aims to change this. 

The primary objective of this project is to see how the introduction of the prototype we develop can lead to human values emerging surrounding the application of affective feedback to news consumption. We endeavor to explore what awareness of affective data might mean to people, and how designers can leverage emerging human values in order to develop socially meaningful applications within this space.
