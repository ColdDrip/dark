#React
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Although few studies have examined the effects of news on consumers’ affective state (Szabo & Hopkinson, 2007), it is commonly understood that news can and does psychologically impact those who consume it (Sisson, 2016; Singal, 2016; Gregoire, 2015; Davey, 2012) but not always in the ways we might expect (*Brutality-Desensitization Process Nearly Complete*, 1999). 

While affective data has already been utilized for recommender systems (Tkalcic, Kosir & Tasic, 2011), the application of affective feedback to news consumption is an unexplored space. There are no commercial products or applications designed to bring ordinary news consumers awareness of their affective state while consuming news. 

Our concept, React, aims to change this. 

The primary objective of this project is to see how the introduction of the prototype we develop can lead to human values emerging surrounding the application of affective feedback to news consumption. We endeavor to explore what awareness of affective data might mean to people, and how designers can leverage emerging human values in order to develop socially meaningful applications within this space.

<h2>Concept</h2>
React is an application that enables users to have greater awareness of the magnitude of their own reactions to particular news stories. It is comprised of a smartphone app and a wearable bracelet. When the smartphone app is open, the bracelet measures the user’s real-time galvanic skin response (“GSR”), which is indicative of psychological or physiological arousal. This data is then sent to the smartphone app, which provides the user with a more detailed report of their reactions to varying news stories.

<h4>How it Works</h4>
The bracelet component of React is intended to be worn regularly by users, but it will only turn on once users open the React smartphone app and press “track” after finding a news story to read or watch (and inputting its url). As users consume the news story, the bracelet will measure and visualize their GSR. When they are done consuming the news story, users must “stop” the tracking (which will also turn off the bracelet). The smartphone app will then provide them with a graph of their GSR throughout the duration of their consumption time as well as their average GSR, their high, and their low (out of 10, where 10 indicates the highest level of arousal). Additionally, users may compare their own data to that of other anonymous users who have consumed the same news story.

Consistently using React will build up a history of data for users to reflect on. Users can begin to understand their own reactions within a wider context. Using React while consuming news will bring about greater awareness of the impact (or potentially lack thereof) of specific news as it’s being consumed.

<h4>Ambiguity & GSR</h4>
There is a lot of ambiguity in GSR because an increase in skin conductance can be the result of either positive or negative stimuli. This ambiguity meshes well with React, as the purpose of the application is not to measure the qualitative nature of arousal, but to instead measure the mere existence of any arousal at all.

<h4>Social Component</h4>
React compiles all user data for every news story and provides an average “reaction magnitude,” allowing users to compare their own reaction to that of others.

<h4>Target Audience</h4>
React is primarily intended for people who want to be more aware of the impact (or lack thereof) that consuming particular news stories has on them (and other people). As specific human values are identified after the introduction of our bracelet prototype, our target audience will become narrower. See “Some Preliminary Notes on the Structure of our Project Plan” under “Plan” for more information regarding the scope of this project.

The data React will collect can bring about greater societal awareness of what news requires in order to provoke arousal. This data can therefore be of great use to journalists and researchers. That being said, the application we will develop within this course will be targeted at ordinary news consumers only. We believe that ordinary news consumers must have a personal incentive for wanting awareness of GSR data before such data could even possibly be tracked on a scale large enough to be sufficiently accessible to journalists and researchers. As such, React encompasses personal use and does not extend consideration to more wide-reaching uses of GSR data (though numerous potentialities for such uses certainly do exist).

<h4>Context</h4>
The initial prototype of React (to be developed before the Week 8 standup presentation) will be constructed in order to deliver awareness to users of their affective state while consuming news stories. The scope of this project, however, extends beyond sheer awareness. We intend to develop a more targeted application that builds on the application we describe above. 

There is so much that can be done with the GSR data that React will collect. Possibilities include:

+ only showing impactful news stories when users wish to consume them
+ making personalized recommendations of “non-numbing” news stories
+ utilizing haptic feedback to indicate to users what the average reaction magnitude was to the news story they are consuming as they are consuming it
+ and so much more...

The purpose of our intended early release of the initial prototype of the application described above is to allow us to more clearly identify human values that emerge in response to the awareness that this prototype provides. For a clearer explanation of why we have chosen to conduct the project in this manner, see “Some Preliminary Notes on the Structure of our Project Plan” under “Plan,” which provides more coherent justifications in regards to the scope of this project.

<h2>Team</h2>
<h4>Members</h4>

<h4>Roles & Responsibilities</h4>
All team members will contribute to all aspects of the project. Members with specific expertise in certain areas will take on leadership roles within those areas and will share their knowledge in order to help other team members help them. Task distribution will vary based on personal preference and skills. As all team members are Master of Interaction Design students, general design-related tasks will be completed by everyone.

<h4>Decision Making</h4>
All team decisions will be made collaboratively. If the team cannot reach a consensus, decisions will be made based on majority rule. In certain circumstances, team members most affected by the outcome of a certain decision may have great power than other members in terms of the decision that gets made (e.g. those in charge of making promotional material will have a greater voice in terms of what that material will be, and what it will look like). Once decisions have been reached, all team members must agree to fully accept, support, and commit to those decisions. If, at any point, a team member does not like a decision that was reached, this issue should be discussed openly within the team. If the decision pertains to an increased workload for that team member, adjustments to the project plan can be made so that workload distribution is more equitable. 

<h4>Issue Handling</h4>
The team may face issues relating to underperformance or conflicts.

In the case that a team member does not complete the work allocated to them within the defined timeframe or to the agreed standard, the rest of the team will discuss the issue with the underperforming team member in hopes that the member will respond to this and put more effort into the project. If, after discussion, the team member is still underperforming, the rest of the team will reallocate the team member’s tasks and responsibilities. If this issue persists throughout the project, the course coordinator will be informed and peer assessment may be requested. 

In general, it is expected that team members inform the rest of the team as soon as possible if they will be unable (for whatever reason) to complete their assigned tasks on time or to the agreed standard. If such events occur, the team must evenly divide the remaining work if no specific team member is keen to take it on alone. Reallocation of other work may also occur in the event that the leftover work to be done does not suit the skill set of all team members.

If there are any disputes within the team, the team will agree to admit that conflict is present and needs to be resolved. Attempts will be made to understand the conflict from all perspectives. Those involved in the conflict should communicate openly with the intentions of reaching an agreement and moving forward. In the case that the team’s attempts at conflict resolution do not succeed, advice will be sought from tutors and the course coordinator.
